This report is the fourth and final document in a series of reports on the design of a Hybrid Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The project is executed by 10 students in 11 weeks for the design synthesis exercise. The first document presents the project plan. In this document, the organisation and planning of the project were described and first steps were taken into the design process. The second dealt with the baseline of the project, including twenty ideas and five concepts that would be investigated further. Also, a market analysis was made. This was followed by the midterm report, which presented an analysis and a trade-off in which one final concept was selected. In this report, the preliminary design of the chosen concept will be discussed. The report will be followed by an executive summary and a poster. Both will give an overview of the project. 

\indent Group 14 would like to thank Ir. J. Sinke, Dr. Ir. E. van Kampen and Ir. S. Rapp for their advise, professional assistance and feedback. The group also sends special thanks to Hybrid UAV companies Avy and Atmos for their advice and specialist feedback.
